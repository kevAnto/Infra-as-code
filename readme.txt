Terraform_AWS

Infrastructure as a Code with Terraform

On my Terraform learning Journey. 
I use Terraform to code couples of architectures and deploy them on AWS.

    Stand alone web server (Linux)
    A VPC, two subnets, SGs, NACL, NAT Gateway, Bastion Host, Instances in each subnet...

nb : after deploying the IaC i will manually add EIP for ec2 in the public sublic subnet.
